# Bitcoin Price Prediction ðŸ“ŠðŸ’°
This project aims to predict the price of Bitcoin using time series data from 2013 to 2020, with a focus on analyzing and forecasting price trends for the period from 2020 to 2023. Predictions are evaluated against actual historical data to assess the model's performance.

## Project Overview
The notebook explores various modeling approaches, from baseline models to advanced deep learning architectures, to capture Bitcoinâ€™s volatility and trend patterns. Each experiment adjusts parameters such as the forecast horizon and window size, providing insights into which models perform best for short-term and long-term predictions.

## Modelling Experiments
Below is a summary of each model used:

- Model 0: Naive Model (Baseline)
- Model 1: Dense Model, Horizon = 1, Window = 7
- Model 2: Dense Model, Horizon = 1, Window = 30
- Model 3: Dense Model, Horizon = 7, Window = 30
- Model 4: Conv1D, Horizon = 1, Window = 7
- Model 5: LSTM, Horizon = 1, Window = 7
- Model 6: Dense Model with Multivariate Data, Horizon = 1, Window = 7
- Model 7: N-BEATS Algorithm, Horizon = 1, Window = 7
- Model 8: Ensemble Model (optimized on multiple loss functions), Horizon = 1, Window = 7
- Model 9: Future Prediction Model, Horizon = 1, Window = 7
- Model 10: Dense Model with Turkey Data Introduced, Horizon = 1, Window = 7

## Dataset
The dataset includes daily Bitcoin price data from 2013 to 2020 for training. The modelâ€™s performance is tested by comparing predictions to actual Bitcoin prices from 2020 to 2023.

## Results
Each model's accuracy is evaluated based on its ability to predict prices in the forecasted period (2020-2023). Results are compared across different architectures and parameters to identify the best-performing model for Bitcoin price prediction.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository.
- Run the notebook to train and evaluate each model.
